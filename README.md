# Lane

**A dead-simple alternative to git worktrees.**

Work on multiple branches at once. No stashing, no context switching. Just `lane feature-x` and you're there.

## How It Works

Lane creates full copies of your repo in sibling directories:

```
~/projects/
├── my-app/                  # Main repo (on main)
├── my-app-lane-a/           # Lane "a" (on feature/login)
├── my-app-lane-b/           # Lane "b" (on fix/bug-123)
├── my-app-lane-testing/     # Lane "testing" (on main)
```

When you run `lane a`, it **creates the copy AND cd's you into it**:

```
~/my-app $ lane a
✓ Lane "a" ready at ~/my-app-lane-a

~/my-app-lane-a $
```

**Lane name ≠ branch name.** Lanes are just directories. You can checkout any branch in any lane:

```
~/my-app-lane-a $ git checkout feature/login
~/my-app-lane-a $ git checkout main
~/my-app-lane-a $ git checkout -b experiment
```

**Coworker sends you a branch?** Use `lane checkout`:

```bash
~/my-app $ lane checkout feature/anna-auth
```

If a lane already has that branch checked out, you'll switch to it. If not, you choose:
- Create a new lane with that branch
- Check it out in an existing lane

**Easy cleanup.** Lanes are just folders. Delete them anytime:

```bash
lane remove a               # Delete lane "a"
lane remove b --delete-branch   # Also delete the git branch
```

Or use the interactive picker (`lane`) to select and bulk-delete multiple lanes at once.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g git+ssh://git@github.com:benhylak/lane.git
lane init-shell
source ~/.zshrc   # or restart your terminal
```

The `init-shell` step is required—it adds a shell function that lets lane change your directory.

## Usage

### Create or switch to a lane
```bash
lane a              # Creates lane "a" if it doesn't exist, or switches to it
lane testing        # Same idea
lane                # No args = interactive picker
lane -              # Go to previous lane (like cd -)
```

### Find a lane by branch
```bash
lane checkout main              # Switch to whichever lane has "main" checked out
lane checkout feature/login     # Find the lane on this branch
```

If no lane has that branch, you'll get options:
- Create a new lane with that branch
- Checkout the branch in an existing lane

### Other commands
```bash
lane list                    # List all lanes
lane remove old-feature      # Delete a lane
lane sync                    # Copy .env files from main repo to current lane
lane config                  # Settings (copy mode, skip node_modules, etc.)
```

## Tips

**Keep lane names short.** They become directory names: `lane a`, `lane testing`, not `lane feature/api-refactor-v2`.

**Large repos?** Run `lane config` and enable "Skip Build Artifacts" to skip `node_modules`, `dist`, etc. Lane will run `npm install` automatically after copying.

## Troubleshooting

**Lane doesn't change directory:** Run `lane init-shell` and restart your terminal.

**"Branch already used by another worktree":** Switch to full copy mode in `lane config`.
